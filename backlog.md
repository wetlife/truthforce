## Todo

- move contents to bottom and link to them OR put in a CSS-drawer

- get latex2html to use vectorized images of formulae

- replace link-to-ref-box with a suitably accessible element

- typeface: embossed ink with several layers of shadow

- holes in paper...?(try div w/in div#paper to space between holes and edge of paper)(how can I see through an HTML-element with CSS?)

## Done

- fix links in contents(they seemed covered by  elements defined by malformed tags)

- makefile gets `sed -i '/^<BR>$/d'` to remove linebreaks in index.html
