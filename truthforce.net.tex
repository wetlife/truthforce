\chapter{Welcome to the Party}
The party gathers to converse about what we have seen.

\chapter{Measurably Minute Math}
We name known and unkown quantities.
We order the numbers.
We specify our certainty of known quantities.
We create data structures to describe collections of numbers.
We learn the standard arithmetic operations.
We imagine a new dimension labeled by a newly imagined number for each kind of number to gain closure over the veracity of all relations of all operations.
We relate quantities.
We learn algebraic manipulations of related quantities.
We calculate variations of related quantities with respect to one another.
We name abstract functions that map between ordered sets of quantities.
We characterize multitudes of data with statistics.

\chapter{Language About Itself}
Language is an intelligently organized connection amongst professors, students, and arbitrarily magnificent concepts.

\chapter{Known Concepts are Language Named Science}

\chapter{Managagement of Wealth as Holistic Health}
Holistic mangement of health can contain a recognition that happiness is a choice.
A choice of happiness may be implemented as the entire management of health.
This choice can be hard to maintain when distractions arise following mismanagement of health.

\chapter{Diet}
Diet can be specified as eating events.
An event specifies what, how, and when food was consumed.
When food is eaten can be specified in a time-basis or frequency-basis.

\chapter{Exercise}
Exercise is a proof of ability that builds itself.

\chapter{Water}
Water can limit feelings of wellbeing.
This is easily enough observed by considering limiting cases.
Getting no water permits no feeling of wellbeing.

\chapter{Sleep}
Sleep deprivation is strongly associated with psychoses which feel familiar from interactions with some denizens of the street.

\chapter{Cancer}
Cancer seems to be advantageously modeled as an organism's adaptive growth in response to changes in stimuli.
